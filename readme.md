## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
## Terraform Commands

Before you can manage your Azure infrastructure using Terraform, you need to execute several Terraform commands. Here are the key commands you'll use:

1. **Initialize Terraform:**

   Run the following command to initialize your Terraform environment. This downloads the necessary provider plugins and sets up your working directory:

   ```bash
   terraform init
2. **Plan Changes:**

   Use the plan command to see what changes Terraform will apply to your infrastructure before executing them. This step is essential for reviewing and validating your configuration.

   ```bash
   terraform plan

3. **Apply Changes:**

   When you're satisfied with the changes proposed in the plan, apply them to your Azure environment.
   
   ```bash
   terraform apply

4. **Destroy Resources (Caution):**

   To tear down and destroy the created resources, use the destroy command. Be extremely cautious when using this command, as it will delete the resources without confirmation.
   
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
